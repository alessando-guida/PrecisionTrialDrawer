Description: We developed a tool to analyze list of genes and
    their alterations in order to create a custom panel for clinical genomics
    studies. It represents a resource to design basket or umbrella clinical trials and 
    provides a suite of methods to simulate an in silico prescription from a gene or 
    drug prospective. Finally, it is possible to design the genomic ranges 
    that will be sequenced in ready-to-be-submitted bed format.
